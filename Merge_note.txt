Here's a note file I'm adding to the Cleaned branch, just so git will let me commit a helpful message to the branch.

The Cleaned branch has been hard-copied onto 'master' at 4pm on Monday, January 15th, just after our first Programming meeting of Term 2. Therefore this branch is more or less closed. /context
